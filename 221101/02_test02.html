    <p> "As I relax on the sofa and gaze around a room a thought hits me:
        this is exactly the place I've been looking for all my life.
        A little hideaway in some sinkhole somewhere.
        I'd always thought of it as a secret, imaginary place, and can barely believe that it actually exists.
        I close my eyes and take a breath, and wonder of it all settles over me like a gentle cloud."
